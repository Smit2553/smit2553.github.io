# Smit's Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website. It is built on the Next.js framework and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

The website is built to showcase my projects and display my resume and contact information.

The main design goal of the website is to be simple and easy to navigate. While still providing all the necessary information in a clean and organized manner.

## Color Palette

The color palette for the website can be found at [https://colorhunt.co/palette/eadfb49bb0c151829bf6995c](https://colorhunt.co/palette/eadfb49bb0c151829bf6995c).

## Demo

The website is live at [smit2553.github.io](https://smit2553.github.io/).

## Development

To run the website locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smit2553/smit2553.github.io.git
```

```bash
cd smit2553.github.io
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

The website should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
